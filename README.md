# BlackBlizzard
The Source Code For My Botnet BlackBlizzard

DISCLAIMER : 
The work you will find here is not enirely original, some parts have been taken from other botnets in the process. But the way it has been
"mixed" too form this, is an original combination.
(some parts are original)

# Info
(Help will not be given to little skids who think it is cool 2 has a kewl botnet but need help on how 2 setup ehehehhehehehehee)

FOR SETUP HELP GOTO THE HELP SECTION

Do not upload this on any webhosting service like InfinityFree or that otherone that people use (the account will be terminated)
I can confirm this works on a free hosting account from x10hosting.com but if we abuse this they will add detection or smn.

There are 2 methods of getting bots

Bruteforce the IP's
Or get someone stupid enough too download and run the exe (too bypass antiviruses quite easily use a cryptor)

# Help

You need a webserver with php and mysql support (php 5.5 and below, a port for higher versions would be greatly appreciated!)


The configuration file is config.php
change the
Database username: 
Database userpass:
Database DBname:
Database DBHost: (typically on free hosting services it is localhost unless specified otherwise like on infinity free but you won't use this on there, right?)

# IMPORTANT HELP
GOTO YOUR DATABASE AND SELECT IMPORT AND THEN SELECT DUMP.SQL AND UPLOAD THAT
ONCE FILES HAVE BEEN UPLOADED VISIT THE FILE importgeoip.php ON YOUR WEBBROWSER IT IMPORTS THE IP SPREADSHEET
ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS CAN YOU PROCEED TO BELOW
(only do this once)
(or if you change the pc you login with you only need 2 do import geo ip part)


too login goto your urls botnet directory (eg: yoururl.com/Botnet) then do /login (eg: yoururl.com/Botnet/login)
default pass and user is 
USER : root (lowercase)
PASS : toor (lowercase)
Once logged in change it in preferences
AND DISABLE KEY IN PREFERENCES TOO IT IS VERY INSECURE!!!! it shows an option with a think like login/?key= yea disable that thing!!
